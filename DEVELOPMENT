Hello,
   Thank you for checking out my package. This file will contain current areas of needed development help and other useful 
   things for those wanting to help develop entangle.

Current Needs
-------------

1. Retry logic (underway)
2. Better error handling and reporting for ssh tasks
3. Dataflow decorator does not currently work with ssh, thus disributed dataflows are broken until this is fixed. 
   ssh scheduler example works fine with workflows though.
4. Support for various @aws decorators
5. Support for database decorators e.g. @mysql, @mongo etc
6. Batch Support with workflow and dataflows
7. Domain specific decorators for working with 3rd party libraries

Thanks!
Darren
